-----------------
1.  INTRODUCTION
-----------------
JFreeChart is a free Java class library for producing charts.
It runs on the Java 2 Platform (JDK 1.3 or later) and uses the Java
2D API for drawing.

JFreeChart is licensed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General
Public Licence (LGPL).  A copy of the licence is included in the
download.

Please note that JFreeChart is distributed WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY;
without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  Please refer to the licence for details.

SPECIAL NOTE: THE JFREECHART API IS NOT YET STABLE.  IT IS SUBJECT TO
CHANGE UNTIL VERSION 1.0.0 IS RELEASED.

-------------------
2.  LATEST VERSION
-------------------
The latest version of this class library can be obtained from:

    http://www.object-refinery.com/jfreechart/index.html

If you have an comments, suggestions or bugs to report, please post a
message in the JFreeChart forum.

------------------
3.  DOCUMENTATION
------------------
You can download installation instructions
(jfreechart-0.9.5-install.pdf) from the JFreeChart home
page or the project page on SourceForge.

The JFreeChart Developer Guide (PDF format) is available for purchase
from the Kagi on-line store (refer to the JFreeChart home page for
more details).  Funds raised from the sale of the guide are used to
sponsor the on-going development of JFreeChart.

Javadoc HTML files are available on-line.  If you wish to keep a local
copy of the Javadoc files, you can regenerate the Javadocs directly
from the source code.  You can do this using the 'javadoc' utility
directly, or with the Ant script (build.xml) included in the
distribution.

-----------------
4.  DEPENDENCIES
-----------------

(a)  JDK 1.3 or later - it might be possible to get JFreeChart working
with JDK 1.2.x, but I haven't tested this lately.  JFreeChart
certainly won't work with JDK 1.1.x, because it requires the Java2D
API which wasn't introduced until JDK 1.2.

(b)  JCommon - version 0.7.2 or later.  The runtime jar file is
included in the JFreeChart distribution.  You can obtain the complete
source code for JCommon from http://www.object-refinery.com.  JCommon
is licensed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public Licence.

(c)  GNU JAXP - a free implementation of the standard XML processing
APIs for Java.

    http://www.gnu.org/software/classpathx/jaxp/

Classes in the com.jrefinery.data.xml package require this library, or
another JAXP v1.1 compliant parser.  The gnujaxp.jar file (from the
gnujaxp-1.0beta1.zip distribution) is included with JFreeChart.  GNU
JAXP is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License
with an additional library exception.

(d)  servlet.jar - NOT INCLUDED IN THE DISTRIBUTION.  You need to
obtain a copy of this file (I used the one in the Tomcat 4.1.18
distribution) and put it in the 'lib' directory if you want to
recompile JFreeChart.  Classes in the com.jrefinery.chart.servlet
package require this file. 

(e)  JUnit - a unit testing framework (the junit.jar runtime file is
included in the distribution).  JUnit is licensed under the terms
of the IBM Common Public License.  You can find out more about JUnit
and/or download the latest version from:

    http://www.junit.org

The JUnit tests included with JFreeChart have been created using JUnit
3.8.

--------------------
5.  ANT BUILD SCRIPT
--------------------

An Ant build script (build.xml) is included in the distribution.  This
is the script that I have used to create the JFreeChart distribution.

For more information about Ant:

    http://ant.apache.org/

Please note that you will need to obtain the servlet.jar file (see the
DEPENDENCIES section above) before running the Ant script.

------------------------
6.  THE DEMO APPLICATION
------------------------
The main demonstration application is called JFreeChartDemo.  To run
it you need the files jcommon-0.7.2.jar, jfreechart-0.9.5.jar and
jfreechart-0.9.5-demo.jar.

Using JDK 1.3 (or later) you can start the demo by running the class:

    com.jrefinery.chart.demo.JFreeChartDemo.

For example, on Linux, the following command line will run the demo
application:

java -classpath lib/jcommon-0.7.2.jar:jfreechart-0.9.5.jar:jfreechart-0.9.5-demo.jar com.jrefinery.chart.demo.JFreeChartDemo

Depending on your system configuration and the current working
directory, you may need to specify paths in the above command line.

If you are using Windows, please note that the entries on the class
path should be separated with a semi-colon rather than a colon:

java -classpath lib/jcommon-0.7.2.jar;jfreechart-0.9.5.jar;jfreechart-0.9.5-demo.jar com.jrefinery.chart.demo.JFreeChartDemo

7.  WHAT's NEW
---------------
A list of changes in recent versions:

0.9.5 : (6-Feb-2003)  PLEASE NOTE THAT MAJOR CHANGES TO THE
        JFREECHART API HAVE BEEN MADE IN THIS RELEASE!

        - added support for secondary axes, datasets and renderers;
        - added new data interfaces (Value, Values, Values2D,
          KeyedValues and KeyedValues2D) and incorporated these into
          the existing PieDataset and CategoryDataset interfaces.
        - modified the CategoryDataset interface to be more
          symmetrical, data is organised in rows and columns (as
          before) but can now be accessed by row/column index or
          row/column key.   
        - added support for reading PieDatasets and CategoryDatasets
          from XML files.
        - created separate packages for the axes
          (com.jrefinery.chart.axis), plots (com.jrefinery.chart.plot)
          and renderers (com.jrefinery.chart.renderer).
        - series attributes (paint, outline paint, stroke and shape)
          are now controlled by the renderer classes using lookup
          tables.  Introduced the DrawingSupplier interface (and
          DefaultDrawingSupplier class) which is used to populate the
          lookup tables from a common source (necessary to coordinate
          complex combined charts).
        - the chart legend can now display shapes corresponding to
          series. 
        - moved responsibility for category distribution to the
          CategoryAxis class, which tidies up the code in the
          CategoryPlot classes.  
        - gridlines are now controlled by the CategoryPlot and XYPlot
          classes, not the axes (included in this change is the
          addition of gridlines for the CategoryPlot domain values).
        - changed the list of titles in the JFreeChart class to a
          title and a list of subtitles.  
        - added new renderers for XYPlot (XYBubbleRenderer and
          YIntervalRenderer).
        - modified Gantt chart to display sub-tasks.
        - added ContourPlot class (still experimental) by David
          M. O'Donnell.
        - introduced new MovingAverage class.
        - ChartMouseEvent now includes source chart.
        - numerous bug fixes.
        - lots of Javadoc updates.

0.9.4 : (18-Oct-2002)  Added a new stacked area chart (contributed by Dan
        Rivett) and a compass plot (contributed by Bryan Scott).  Updated
        the ThermometerPlot class. Added a new XYDotRenderer for scatter
        plots. Modified combined and overlaid plots to use the series colors
        specified in the sub plot rather than the parent plot (this makes it
        easier to align the colors in the legend).  Added Regression class
        for linear and power regressions.  BasicTimeSeries can now
        automatically drop "old" data.  Some clean-up work in the code for
        tooltips and the event listener mechanism.  Richard Atkinson has
        incorporated some useful extensions for servlets/JSP developers.

        Ran Checkstyle and corrected issues reported for most classes.
        Checkstyle is a free utility that you can download from:

            http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net

        Fixed bugs and updated documentation.

        API changes include:
        - added tickMarkPaint to Axis constructor (also affects subclasses);
        - added getLegendItems() to Plot, and deprecated getLegendItemLabels();
        - added getLegendItem(int) to XYItemRenderer and CategoryItemRenderer.
        - most 'protected' member variables have been changed to 'private'.

0.9.3 : (4-Sep-2002) Added multiple pie charts based on
        CategoryDataset.  Updated logarithmic axes.  Improved URL
        support for image map generation. Moved the com.jrefinery.data
        package from JCommon to JFreeChart. Added simple framework for
        chart annotations. Improved control over renderers. Duplicate
        x-values now allowed in XYSeries. Optional category label
        skipping in category axes. Added CategoriesPaint attribute to
        AbstractCategoryItemRenderer.  Added new attributes to
        MeterPlot class. Updated 3D pie chart to observe start angle
        and direction, and also foreground alpha < 1.0. Improved
        Javadoc comments. New demo applications, including:
        AnnotationDemo1, EventFrequencyDemo, JDBCCategoryChartDemo,
        JDBCPieChartDemo, JDBCXYChartDemo and MinMaxCategoryPlotDemo.
        Bug fixes:
        - negative percentages on PiePlot.
        - added listener notification to setXXXAxis(...) methods.
        - fixed DomainInfo method name clash.
        - added DomainIsPointsInTime flag to TimeSeriesCollection to
          give better control over auto range on axis for time series
          charts.
        - axis margins for date axes are no longer hard-coded.
        - fix for ordering of categories in JdbcCategoryDataset.
        - added check for null axis in mouse click handler.

        The CVS repository at SourceForge has also been restructured
        to match the distribution directory layout.

0.9.2 : (28-Jun-2002) PiePlot now has startAngle and direction
        attributes.  Added support for image map generation.  Added a
        new Pie3DPlot class. Added label drawing code to bar
        renderers. Added optional range markers to horizontal number
        axis.  Added bar clipping to avoid PRExceptions in bar
        charts.  JFreeChartDemo has been modified and now includes
        examples of the dial and thermometer plots.
        Bug fixes:
        - auto range for VerticalNumberAxis when zero is forced to be
          included in the range.
        - fixed null pointer exception in StackedVerticalBarRenderer3D;
        - Added get/set methods for min/max chart drawing dimensions
          in ChartPanel;
        - HorizontalIntervalBarRenderer now handles single category;
        - verticalTickLabels now possible in HorizontalNumberAxis3D;
        - removed unnecessary imports;

0.9.1 : (14-Jun-2002) Bug fixes and Javadoc updates.
        - fixed auto range calculation for category plots;
        - fixed event notification for XYPlot;
        - fixed auto axis range for Gantt charts;
        - check for null popup menu in ChartPanel.mouseDragged;
        - new checks for null info in renderers;
        - range markers now drawn only if in visible axis range;

0.9.0 : (7-Jun-2002) New plots including an area chart, a horizontal
        3D bar chart, a Gantt chart and a thermometer chart.
        Combination plots have been reworked to provide a
        simpler framework, and extends to allow category plots to be
        combined. There is now a facility to add a ChartMouseListener
        to the ChartPanel (formerly JFreeChartPanel).  An interactive
        zooming feature (experimental at this point) is now available
        for XYPlots.  A new Polish translation has been added. Several
        fixes have been applied to the default tool tip generators.  A
        workaround has been added to fix the alignment between time
        series charts and the date axis.  There are some improvements
        to the VerticalLogarithmicAxis class, and now a corresponding
        HorizontalLogarithmicAxis class.  Additional demonstration
        applications have been added.  Fixed the popup menu bug.

0.8.1 : (5-Apr-2002) Localised resource bundles for French, German and
        Spanish languages (thanks to Anthony Boulestreau, Thomas Meier
        and Hans-Jurgen Greiner for the translations).  An area XY
        plot and meter chart contributed by Hari.  Symbol charts
        contributed by Anthony Boulestreau. An improved
        CandleStickRenderer class from Sylvain Vieujot.  Updated
        servlet code from Bryan Scott.  XYItemRenderers now have a
        change listener mechanism and therefore do not have to be
        immutable.  Additional demonstration applications for
        individual chart types. Minor bug fixes.

0.8.0 : (22-Mar-2002) All the category plots are now controlled
        through the one class (CategoryPlot) with plug-in renderers.
        Added a ResourceBundle for user interface items that require
        localisation. Added a logarithmic axis class contributed by
        Mike Duffy and some new JDBC and servlet code contributed by
        Bryan Scott.  Updated the JCommon class library to improve
        handling of time periods in different time zones.

0.7.4 : (6-Mar-2002) Bug fixes in the JCommon Class Library. Various
        Javadoc comment updates.  Some minor changes to the
        code. Added new domain name (http://www.object-refinery.com)
        in the source headers.

0.7.3 : (14-Feb-2002) Bug fixes.

0.7.2 : (8-Feb-2002) Integrated the WindPlot code from Achilleus
        Mantzios. Added an optional background image for the
        JFreeChart class, and another optional background image for
        the Plot class.  Added alpha-transparency for the plot
        foreground and background.  Added new pie chart label types
        that show values.  Fixed a bug with the legend that results in
        a loop at small chart sizes. Added some tooltip methods that
        were missing from the previous version. Changed the Insets
        class on chart titles to a new Spacer class that will allow
        for relative or absolute insets (the plan is to eventually
        replace all Insets in the JFreeChart classes).  Fixed a bug in
        the setAutoRangeIncludesZero method of the NumberAxis class.
        Added the instructions that were missing from the copies of
        the GNU Lesser General Public Licence included with JFreeChart.

0.7.1 : (25-Jan-2002) Added tooltips, crosshairs and zooming
        functions, thanks to Jonathan Nash and Hans-Jurgen Greiner
        for contributing the code that these features are based on.
        Moved the combination charts into the package
        com.jrefinery.chart.combination, made a number of other small
        API changes and fixed some bugs.  Removed the Javadoc HTML
        from the download to save space (you can regenerate it from
        the source code if you need it).

0.7.0 : (11-Dec-2001) New combination plots developed by Bill
        Kelemen.  Added Wolfgang Irler's servlet demo to the standard
        download.  The About window in the demo application now
        includes a list of developers that have contributed to the
        project.

0.6.0 : (27-Nov-2001) New plots including scatter plot, stacked bar
        charts and 3D bar charts.  Improved pie chart.  Data
        interfaces and classes moved to the JCommon class library.
        New properties to control spacing on bar charts.  New
        auto-tick mechanism.  JFreeChartPanel now incorporates
        buffering, and popup menu.  Javadocs revised.  Fixed numerous
        bugs from version 0.5.6.  Demo application updated.
