			<H3>PrettyPrinter</H3>

			<P>The first piece of software is a pretty printer for Java.
			It reads a java file or a directory structure containing
			java files. It reformats the code and inserts javadoc
			comments where they are missing.</P>

			<P>This new version takes a look at the name of the method.
			If the method is a setter or getter, it takes an intelligent
			stab at filling in the javadoc comments, based on the name
			of the method, the class, and whether the method is static
			or not.</P>

			<P>If the method is named run or it appears to be the main
			program, the javadoc comments are also generated appropriately.
			The exact words in the default descriptions for all methods
			are located in the <A HREF="csprettysettings.html">pretty.settings</A>
			file.
			</P>

			<P>Also new this release is the ability to set the level of
			protection that the system inserts javadoc comments.  For
			instance, if the user of this program only wants javadoc
			comments for public methods and public fields, the user
			sets the method.minimum level to be public in the
			<A HREF="csprettysettings.html">pretty.settings</A>
			file.</P>

			<P>At the moment, there is no interface to the pretty printer
			settings except by directly editing the
			<A HREF="csprettysettings.html">pretty.settings</A> files.
			The location of the <A HREF="csprettysettings.html">pretty.settings</A>
			file depends on the way
			you are using the pretty printer.</P>

			<H3>Installation and Usage</H3>

			<H4>Command line</H4>

			<P>To install the pretty printer to use it from the command line,
			simply add the refactory.jar file to the class path.  The following
			table describes it's use.</P>

		<H4>Elixir IDE</H4>

		<P>Installation depends on the version of Elixir that you have.</P>

		<P><B>Version 2.4</B>  If
		you have version Elixir version 2.4, then you place the refactory-2.4.jar
		file in <EM>&lt;Your Home Directory&gt;</EM><tt>/.ElixirIDE/2.4/ext</tt>.</P>

		<P><B>Version 2.2</B>  If you have version 2.2, then add refactory-2.4.jar
		to your classpath.  Then add the refactory-2.4.jar file to your classpath.
		You also need to edit the file named ide.scm in
		<EM>&lt;Your Home Directory&gt;</EM><tt>/.ElixirIDE/2.2</tt>.  Add the
		following lines to the end of the file.</P>

		<TT>
		<PRE>
;  Chris's Extensions start here
(define prettyprint
    (method "prettyPrint" "org.acm.seguin.pretty.ElixirPrettyPrinter")
)

(add-menu-item "Script|-")
(add-menu-item "Script|Pretty Printer=(prettyprint)")


(println "Done Chris's extensions")

		</PRE>
		</TT>

		<P><B>Version 2.0 or earlier</B>  If you are using Elixir IDE 2.0 or
		earlier, and you want to use the latest release of the pretty printer,
		please contact me.</P>

		<P>With any version of Elixir IDE, to use the pretty printer select
		the Script menu item, then select Pretty Printer while the current
		window hold a java file.</P>

		<H4>NetBeans</H4>

		<P>To install this software, install the file
		JRefactoryModule.jar in the module directory.</P>

		<P>To use this software, open the .java file
		and the pretty printer option appears on the tools
		menu.</P>

		<H4>Symantec Visual Cafe</H4>

		<P>Note that this software is somewhat experimental.</P>

		<P>To install the software with Symantec's Visual Cafe version 3.0,
		place refactory-2.4.jar in
		<EM>&lt;Visual Cafe Directory&gt;</EM><tt>/bin/components</tt>.
		Then edit the sc.ini file in
		<EM>&lt;Visual Cafe Directory&gt;</EM><tt>/bin</tt>.  Add to the
		end of the line that specifies the classpath, the following:
		</P>
		<TT>
		<PRE>
;%@P%\COMPONENTS\refactory-2.4.jar
		</PRE>
		</TT>

		<P>Once you restart Symantec's Visual Cafe, there will be a new menu
		option "Extensions" with one item "Pretty Printer".  To run the pretty
		printer on the current viewed file, select Pretty Printer from the
		menu.</P>

		<P>Note for Visual Cafe only, the <A HREF="csprettysettings.html">pretty.settings</A>
		file is located in
		<TT>c:\visualcafe\.refactory</TT>.</P>

		<P>For Visual Cafe 4.0, there seems to be a problem reading a file
		from a disk, so I am unable to read the settings files.  I'm working
		on this problem.</P>

		<H4>JBuilder 3.0 Foundation or JBuilder 3.5 or JBuilder 4.0</H4>

		<P>To use the pretty printer with JBuilder, the refactory-2.4.jar in
                <EM>JBuilderDir</EM>/lib/ext.  See the file jbuilder.txt for more
                specific information.</P>

		<H4>JBuilder 3.0</H4>

		<P>To use the pretty printer with JBuilder, you will need to create
		a batch file.  This file takes one input.  It sets the classpath
		to include the pretty printer, and then runs the pretty printer
		on the input file.  Here is a sample batch file.</P>

		<TT>
		<PRE>
set classpath=c:\jars\refactory-2.4.jar
java PrettyPrinter %1
		</PRE>
		</TT>

		<P>Then edit the tools.cfg file in <EM>&lt;JBuilder Directory&gt;</EM><TT>/bin</TT>
		directory.  You should add the following 4 lines to the end of the file.</P>

		<TT>
		<PRE>
Pretty Printer
c:\bin\pretty.bat
.
$(NodeName)
		</PRE>
		</TT>

		<P>Note that the second line is the path to the pretty printer batch file
		that you created.  Also, each item in the tools.cfg file consists of
		4 lines.  The calculator item has nothing in the fourth line (it doesn't
		need anything).</P>

		<P>To use the pretty printer, save the file to disk.  Then select tools
		from the menu and pretty printer.</P>

		<P>Debugging:  If you don't see Pretty Printer on the tools menu and
		instead see "c:\bin\pretty.bat", then you need to insert a blank line
		before the PrettyPrinter line.</P>

		    <P>Release 2.5.38 fixes a bug where a /* C style comment */
		    appears on the same line as source code, and the code before
		    the comment is deleted (with appropriate settings in the
		    pretty.settings file).</P>

		    <P>Release 2.5.23 gives more control over the placement and
		    formatting of comments.  It also allows the user to specify
		    the directory containing the settings files.  This also indents
		    the variable name in fields.</P>

		    <P>Release 2.4.42 adds better space control after keywords and
		    in expressions.  It also can place the catch and else statements
		    on the same line as the closing brackets.  Many thanks to
		    <B>Matt Mower</B> for making these changes!</P>
		    <P>Release 2.4.34 adds the ability to insert a space before
		    the @ symbols in the javadoc tags.  It also can sort the
		    import statements.</P>

		    <P>Version 2.4.31 added JBuilder support.</P>

		    <P>Release 2.4.18 adds a number of new features for controlling
		    the output.  You can add a standard header for the
		    file, which replaces the current header if it is present.</P>

		    <P>It also fixes a problem for Linix/Unix users, that the
		    directory containing the settings was sometimes referenced
		    with capital letters, and other times referenced with lower
		    case letters.</P>

            <P>Release 2.4.10 adds more control of javadoc comments - like
            minimum and maximum number of characters to wordwrap and the
            number of *s at the beginning and end of the javadoc comment.
            It also allows you to control whether there is a space after
            the cast command.</P>

		<P>Release 2.4.6 fixes bug that would delete javadoc comment for
		  @param and @exception tags.</P>
		<P>Release 2.4.5 adds javadoc for JUnit methods, class javadoc
                minimum levels, and a fix for the line number tool so that multiple
                files can be loaded.  There may be some other minor changes, as
                I've implemented JUnit unit and functional tests.  This release
                passes all my tests.</P>
		<P>Release 2.4 adds intelligent javadoc for run and main methods.
		It also adds more control as to when to insert the javadoc comments.
		Finally, it provides a plugin for JBuilder and Symantec's Visual
		Cafe.</P>

            <P>Release 2.2.3 adds intelligent javadoc for getter and setter
            methods.</P>
            <P>Release 2.2 fixes a bug with allocating
            and initializing arrays of objects.</P>
			<P>Release 1.2 added a lot of new features.
			It also is much more robust using javacc's static parser
			rather than trying to create a separate parser for each file.
			Here is a list of the changes:</P>

			<UL>
			<LI> Indent with tabs or other characters
			<LI> Specify the number of blank lines between methods.
			<LI> Reformats the HTML in javadoc comments
			<LI> Bug Fix:  the parser failing with a null pointer exception
			on some files.
			<LI>  Bug Fix:  it does not include the \r when the result
			is passed to Elixir.
			<LI>  Bug Fix:  keeps comments in around {}
			</UL>
