<P>I've been developing some software which I would like to share with
the Java community. The software is free,
and I provide it as is. (If you use it and find any bugs,
<A HREF="mailto:seguin@acm.org">let me know</A>. However,
since I do this for the fun of it, so please don't expect a fix in a day.</P>
<P>A number of the tools described below are Elixir Plugins.
The <A HREF="http://www.elixirtech.com">Elixir IDE</A> is an excellent IDE.
Since it is written in Java, and distributed
in a jar file it is possible to extend the editor.
This is what I have done for the pretty printer, microsoft's
visual source safe, and Java 1.2 printing.
</P>
<P>JBuilder is now the best IDE for the price.  It uses
a lot of memory but has a lot of features.  The low end
version is free, but if you are doing server side development,
you really need the Professional or Enterprise versions.
JRefactory and the pretty printer fully integrate with
this tool.  A couple of people have asked if JRefactory
could be used from popup menus in the structure pane.
It's in release 2.6.12!</P>

<P>NetBeans is viaing for the most popular IDE right
now.  Support for the pretty printer and the extract
method refactoring are present in this release!  Thanks
to Jason Yip of Thoughtworks!</P>

<P>Visual Cafe is a good tool.  I had a lot of bad luck
with it though.  (My hard disk has corrupted a couple of
the DLLs and I can't run it any more.)  JRefactory supports
pretty printing and extracting methods for Visual Cafe.</P>
<P>Other editors are on the horizon.  I'll either look
at integrating with JEdit next.  Visual Age
for Java is the hardest, and if you know VA4J really
well and can answer some questions, please e-mail me.
Thanks!</P>
			<P>  Here is a list of tools that I've developed:</P>
			<P>
			  <P><FONT SIZE='4'><A HREF="cspretty.html">Pretty Printer/Beautifier</A></FONT>
			  is a tool
			  that allows you to clean up the indenting and formatting of your
			  java source code.</P>

			  <P>This tool has a powerful feature of being able
			  to insert the appropriate javadoc comments so that the javadoc
			  program does not generate error messages for missing fields.  To
			  simplify writing javadoc comments, some methods have javadoc
			  comments automatically generated based on the name of the method.</P>

			  <P><FONT SIZE='4'><A HREF="csrefactory.html">JRefactory</A></FONT>
			  is a tool that allows you
			  to perform the following refactorings:
			  <UL>
			  <LI>  Move class between packages (repackage)
			  <LI>  Rename class
			  <LI>  Add abstract parent class
			  <LI>  Add child class
			  <LI>  Remove empty class
			  <LI>  Extract interface
			  <LI>  Push up field
			  <LI>  Push down field
			  <LI>  (<B>New!!</B>) Rename Field
			  <LI>  Push up method
			  <LI>  Push up abstract method
			  <LI>  Push down method
			  <LI>  Move method
			  <LI>  Extract method
			  <LI>  (<B>New!!</B>) Rename Parameter
			  </UL>
			  <P>It updates other java source files
			  as appropriate.</P>
			  <P>This tool comes as a command line option with GUI or without, and
			  as a plugin for the JBuilder, NetBeans, and Elixir IDEs.</P>

			  <P>For JBuilder and Elixir you can now
			  switch from the UML diagram to the source code.</P>

			  <P><FONT SIZE='4'><A HREF="csprint.html">Printing</A></FONT>
			  provides the ability to print UML diagrams and print text
			  files.  Printing includes line numbering and may include
			  syntax highlighting.</P>

			  <P><FONT SIZE='4'><A HREF="cselixirext.html">Elixir Extensions</A></FONT>
			  provides the ability to
			  check in/check out files from Microsoft's
			  Visual Source Safe from inside Elixir.</P>

			  <P><FONT SIZE='4'><A HREF="cslineno.html">Line Number Tool</A></FONT>
			  a command line program to
			  format a number of java source code files and generate an output file
			  with line numbers.  It can also combine a number of files together,
			  and keep the numbering scheme between files.  I've found this useful
			  for code reviews.</P>

			  <P><FONT SIZE='4'><A HREF="csmetrics.html">Metrics</A></FONT>
			   gathers metrics about your java
			  source code.<P>

			  <P><FONT SIZE='4'><A href="csstub.html">Stub Generator</A></FONT>
			  creates a file that allows the refactory tool
			  to display Java 1.2 library classes (or other applications where you
			  have access to the source code, but you don't intend to change the
			  source code).  This facility is used for the refactoring tool to show
			  classes from 3rd party vendors in the refactoring GUI.</P>

			  <P><FONT SIZE='4'><A href="csdevutil.html">Development Utilities</A></FONT>
			  are various development utilities that I use to create builds of
			  these tools.</P>
