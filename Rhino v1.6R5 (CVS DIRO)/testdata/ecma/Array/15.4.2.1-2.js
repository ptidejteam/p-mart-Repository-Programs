   (15.4.3.1).

   The [[Class]] property of the newly constructed object
   is set to "Array".

   The length property of the newly constructed object is
   set to the number of arguments.

   The 0 property of the newly constructed object is set
   to item0... in general, for as many arguments as there
   are, the k property of the newly constructed object is
   set to argument k, where the first argument is
   considered to be argument number 0.
